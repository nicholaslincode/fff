            Dear FFFriends, today eight of us (including a baby) cooked up some sourdough pancakes. Some pancakes were
            flat while others were chonky. Good times were had.

        <h3>History of FFF:</h3>
        <p>
          In the frosty depths of winter, in the year 2023, a daring band of misfits gathered to undertake a feat many
          deemed impossible: the alchemical fermentation of tempeh. This endeavor was to be undertaken within the
          hallowed halls of a scholarly institution. Disregarding the strictures of aseptic practice, the room was
          strewn with remnants of revelry — chips and biscuits were scattered upon the working table, a boardgame was
          underway, and a poopy-diapered baby was but a stone's throw from the experimental setup. Undeterred by these
          distractions, the intrepid collective pressed on, their labor shrouded in secrecy as they toiled on a fateful
          Friday at the hour of five past noon. Miraculously, by Monday's break of dawn, the soybeans had undergone
          their mystic transformation, and by the midweek, the tempeh was partaken of by a select few, none of whom
          suffered any ill effects. Some whispered in awe that this creation surpassed even the grandest expectations.
          Such an achievement, defying all conventional wisdom, begged a singular question: could it be that the
          poopy-diapered baby, so innocently nestled nearby, was not merely mortal flesh, but none other than the second
          coming of the Messiah? Was it this holy presence that blessed the tempeh with abundant proliferation? In the
          wake of this triumph, the concept of FFF was born — a celebration of fermentation and the microbial forces
          that guide it. And so, each month, as the month wanes, this fellowship gathers to honor this mystical craft,
          their hearts brimming with gratitude for all things fermented.
